# UlamInterviewTask

This is an app for recruitment process. It's simple and clear. It has only drag & drop field and also map from Google Maps.
For getting locations by addresses it uses PositionStack API: https://positionstack.com/

## Setting up

It just needs basic commands:
```
npm install
```
and
```
npm start
```

## Is it deployed somewhere?

Yes, of course. It's on Netlify: https://ulam-interview-task.netlify.app/
But there's a problem with HTTPS and HTTP because the API of PositionStack is running on HTTP so there is a problem with calling it. It requires hosting with HTTP which is not supported on Netlify (I should search somewhere else) or upgrading PositionStack (but it requires money ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸).

So I would need some time to figure out how to solve it.
